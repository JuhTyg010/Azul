# Board game Azul

### Marek Sádovský

- Implementation of the game Azul (game loop(s), rules of the game)
- Implementation of logic that can be connected to the CLI or GUI.
- The game in this stage will be only for humans and they will play it on one device.
- Implementation details:  
    - the language of use is C# .net 7
    - platform of development is Linux but it should work on Windows too
    - for build development I'll use Unity for graphical solution

- Libraries: 
    - for the logic standard libraries should be enough
    - for GUI I plan to use Unity so unity standard libraries
