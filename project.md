# Board game Azul

### Marek Sádovský

- Implementation of the game Azul (game loop(s), rules of the game)
- Implementation of logic that can be connected to the CLI or GUI.
- The game in this stage will be only for humans and they will play it on one device.
- Implementation details:  
    the language of use is C++ 23
    platform of development is Linux but it should work on Windows too
    for build development I'll Cmake, and for final the work I'll pack the project

- Libraries: 
    for the logic standard libraries should be enough
    for GUI I plan to use the SFML library
