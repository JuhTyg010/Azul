Welcome to Azul!  
Azul takes its theme from Portugese history, when the then King was amazed by the Moorish decorative tiles used in an Alhambra in southern Spain.
He immediately set workers to using the stunning tiles to decorate the walls of his palace in Evora.
The players of Azul take on the roles of a tiler, seeking to create the best work of art to impress the King.
